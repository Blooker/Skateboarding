Flat ground: Move char forward along flat surface

Ramp: Move char forward along angled surface, get some air at end

Curved ramp/quarter pipe/half pipe: Use splines to snap char to curve?

Bowl: Same as above, except snap player to edge of bowl. Gotta think about how the player will be able to exit bowl
